## Fine-Tuning Process Using the "Model Builder Interface, SUDOBRAIN Training Toolkit UI"

### 1. Introduction

The provided application is a GUI based python script designed to facilitate the fine-tuning of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The application allows users to:

- Input their OpenAI API key.
- Select a folder containing `.txt` files.
- Process these `.txt` files using the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- Convert the processed content into a dataset format suitable for fine-tuning.
- Initiate the fine-tuning process using the OpenAI API.
- View conversion logs and edit `.txt` files.
- Display the folder contents and results of the operations.

### 2. Key Functions

#### 2.1 `process_with_chatgpt(txt_content, api_key)`

- **Purpose**: Processes a given text content using the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- **Parameters**:
  - `txt_content`: The text to be processed.
  - `api_key`: The OpenAI API key.
- **Process**:
  - The function sets the OpenAI API key.
  - It then sends the `txt_content` to the OpenAI API for processing.
  - The processed response is returned.

#### 2.2 `content_to_dataset(validated_content, dataset_file)`

- **Purpose**: Converts the processed content into a dataset format.
- **Parameters**:
  - `validated_content`: The processed content.
  - `dataset_file`: The file where the dataset will be saved.
- **Process**:
  - The function writes the `validated_content` to the `dataset_file` in JSON format.

#### 2.3 `train_model(api_key, training_file)`

- **Purpose**: Initiates the fine-tuning process using the OpenAI API.
- **Parameters**:
  - `api_key`: The OpenAI API key.
  - `training_file`: The dataset file to be used for fine-tuning.
- **Process**:
  - The function sets the OpenAI API key.
  - It sends the `training_file` to the OpenAI API for fine-tuning.
  - The ID of the fine-tuning job is returned.

#### 2.4 `convert_files(folder_path, api_key)`

- **Purpose**: Processes `.txt` files in a given folder and converts them into a dataset format.
- **Parameters**:
  - `folder_path`: The path to the folder containing the `.txt` files.
  - `api_key`: The OpenAI API key.
- **Process**:
  - For each `.txt` file in the `folder_path`, the content is read and processed using the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
  - The processed content is then added to the dataset.
  - The dataset is saved in the `folder_path` as "dataset.json".

### 3. GUI Components

The script uses `tkinter` to create a graphical user interface. Key components include:

- **API Configuration Section**: Allows users to input their OpenAI API key.
- **File and Training Section**: Provides buttons to select a folder with `.txt` files and start the training process.
- **Logs and Editing Section**: Allows users to view conversion logs and edit `.txt` files.
- **Folder Contents Section**: Displays the contents of the selected folder.
- **Results Section**: Displays the results of the operations.

### 4. Conclusion

The "Model Builder Interface, SUDOBRAIN Training Toolkit UI" script provides a comprehensive tool for users to fine-tune the GPT-3.5-turbo model using their own `.txt` files. The process involves processing the `.txt` files, converting them into a dataset format, and initiating the fine-tuning process using the OpenAI API.
